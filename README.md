# NBAPEX
NBAPex is a semi-serious  project that I've used to explore new methodologies, frameworks, tools, etc. while working on a subject matter that I am passionate about. It's fallen byt the wayside recently as the NBA has gotten more restrictive regarding usage of their API.

NBAPex uses the stats.nba.com REST API to gather its data. From there, parts of the project are what you might find on any stats website such as a listing of team statistics for a given season. There is a fantasy sports component where I've implemented a few features I haven't seen in other fantasy games, such a 3+ team trades, trading draft picks, and other things of that nature. The fantasy component is still under active development. 

Additionally, I implemented a tool that allows you to view a team's roster on any given date, and how those players came to be on the team. The RosterHistory tool was implemented using d3.js. While exploring d3.js, I also created a tool that allows users to build custom queries for the database, view the data, and export it in a few different formats. The data exporter shows the database's relationships in real time, as the user selects which tables she wishes to query. Finally, users can also every shot a player has ever taken, and how that player's shot chart has progressed throughout his career with the ShotChart tool.

This is just a quick overview of what I've done here so far.
